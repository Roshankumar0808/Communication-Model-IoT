    <h1>Communication Models</h1>
    <br>
    <p>There are many technologies that enable IoT. Crucial to the field is the network used to communicate between devices of an IoT installation, a role that several wireless or wired technologies may fulfil. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Communication models are broadly categorized as: 
    </p>
    <p>1.Short-range wireless 
    </p>
    <p>2.Long- range wireless 
    </p>
    <p>3.Wired 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Bluetooth low energy (BLE)</h2>
    <p>1.Short-range communications technology 
    </p>
    <p>2.Standard: Bluetooth 4.2 core specification 
    </p>
    <p>3.Frequency: 2.4GHz (ISM) 
    </p>
    <p>4.Data Rates: 1Mbps </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Light-Fidelity (Li-Fi) </h2>
    <p>Wireless communication technology similar to the Wi-Fi standard, but uses visible light communication for increased bandwidth. 
    </p>
<br>
<h2>Near-field communication (NFC)</h2>
<p>Communication protocols enabling two electronic devices to communicate within a 4 cm range. 
    It enables simple and safe two-way interactions between electronic devices and especially applicable for smartphones, allowing consumers to perform contactless payment  transactions
    Standard: ISO/IEC 18000-3 .
    Frequency: 13.56MHz (ISM) .
    Range: 10cm Data Rates: 100â€“420kbps 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>QR codes and barcodes</h2>
    <p>Machine readable optical tags that store information about the item to which they are attached.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) </h2>
    <p>Technology using electromagnetic fields to read data stored in tags embedded in other items.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Communication APIs</h2>
    <p>Application Programming Interface (API) is created for a specific application. 
    </p>
    <p>APIs are necessary to control devices. APIs hold together connected 'things' in an IoT system. 
    </p>
    <p>APIs aid in transferring information between programs from one application to another. 
    </p>
    <p>An API should be developed keeping in mind reusable patterns and automated deployment. 
    </p>
    <p>classified as:REST based Communication API 
    </p>
    <p>WebSocket based Communication API 
    </p>
